Work with researchers and industrial scientists to implement scientific software. This often has an emphasis on numerical models, control of hardware, data processing algorithms, and visualisation.

## Case studies

[Solcore](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore5) is a leading open-source solar cell simulation framework. We have contributed to its earlier versions by implementing semiconductor simulation techniques from published scientific works and wrote code to provide easy access to these simulation tools.

The [pvtrace](https://github.com/danieljfarrell/pvtrace) ray-tracing framework simplifies the problem of ray-tracing luminescent materials that re-emit optical radiation in response to illumination. Such materials have interesting applications in building integrated photovoltaics as they give the designer options using shape and color that cannot be achived with flat panel technologies.
