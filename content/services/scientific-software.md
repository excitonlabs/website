Work with researchers and industrial scientists to implement scientific software. This often has an emphasis on numerical models, control of hardware, data processing algorithms, and visualisation.

For example, see [pvtrace](https://github.com/danieljfarrell/pvtrace) and [solcore](https://github.com/qpv-research-group/solcore5) for two scientific projects we have been involved in.
