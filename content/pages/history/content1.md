Hi, I'm Daniel. I started Exciton Labs in 2015 because I have a passion for working on challenging technical problems with talented teams and individuals.

My background is in physics, and I have spent many years working professionally on software, electronics, and hardware projects.

I found a niche working on product development and internal projects. My background in physics enables me to understand the fundamentals at play, and I complement this foundation with strong technical skills in software and electronics. I like to come up with new and innovative solutions to problems, and I have generated several patents for the organizations where I have worked.
